# Turnex v1.1.0 (2025-09-20)

## Added
- QR generator in App Download section:
  - Inline SVG placeholder to avoid empty box.
  - Runtime QR generation via `qrcodejs` (CDN) using `data-qr` target.
- Service cards: consistent layout (flex), description line-clamp, and staggered reveal animation on render.
- Category UI: 3D tilt + sheen + parallax, scroll arrows, animated counters.

## Changed
- Auth modal: improved signup UX, toggled required fields in signup mode, clearer error messages (network/CORS handling).
- CSS polish for dark mode in multiple components (including QR mock).
- Service Worker cache busting and safer caching to ensure users see updates.

## Fixed
- Visibility issues due to caching: cache-busting query params and SW version bump.
- Card misalignment across breakpoints.
